    "The goal of Lab 06 | Ancestral states is to calculate the likelihood of observed character states given a phylogenetic tree along with branch lengths. The likelihoods will also be used to infer the most likely ancestral state at each position in the tree. This can be done manually or using dynamic programming and a recursion to implement Felsenstein’s pruning algorithm.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we calculated the likelihood of two aligned sequences under various nucleotide substitution models. However, in many instances we are interested in the likelihood of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). For a given column at position $i$ of a multiple sequence alignment, we want to calculate $P(D_i | \\tau; M)$, where $\\tau$ is a phylogenetic tree and $M$ is a nucleotide substitution model. Assuming sites and lineages evolve independently of one another, the probability is thus the product of the probabilities at each site:  \n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_i$ is the ith site. This means we only need to know how to compute the likelihood at a single site.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional probability given a tree brings a complex new dimension to the problem. In phylogenetics the goal is to find a tree that maximizes the likelihood. Each tree that is considered consists of both a single topology but also the branch lengths separating the nodes and leaves on the tree. Thus, to consider the likelihood of a single tree topology one must find the branch lengths that give the highest likelihood of the data given the topology. Finding the best tree is hard since there are so many tree topologies that need to be evaluated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will focus on how to calculate the likelihood of the data *given* both a tree and branch lengths. Even in this simpler situation, the likelihood is not straightforward to calculate because we don't know the ancestral states present at each node.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the likelihood of the data over all possible ancestral states is not only relevant to evaluating the likelihood of various tree topologies, it is also needed to infer ancestral states, estimate branch lengths in a tree, compare different substitution models and in many other likelihood based methods that uses multiple sequence alignments.

These dictionaries have two key-value pairs: the descendent *node* and the descendent *branch* length. In this dictionary, $L_1 - L_5$ is represented by keys $1-5$ and $N_6 - N_9$ is represented by keys $6-9$. Since leaves have no descendents, the list has only one item."

The equation is a recursion since evaluation of $L_k(s)$ requires evaluation of two other calls of the same likelihood equation $L_l(x)$ and $L_m(y)$. The recursion ends when the tips are reached since the states at the tips are observed.
